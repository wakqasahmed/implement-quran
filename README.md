# Let's Implement Quran (دعونا تنفذ القرآن الكريم)

### The way of companions (علي المنهج الصحابه)

## Why Implement?

Quran was revealed to be recited, understood, implementing and spreading its message to the mankind. However, in this time and age, we are merely satisfied upon reciting it and not implementing it in our lives as it is required to be implemented.

We have been exposed to verses of Quran through lectures and speeches from the scholars (in Masjid or online) but since we don't follow a curriculum, we don't know where we stand in terms following and practicing Quran in its entirety. As Allah instructs us in the Quran

Udkhulo Bissilmi Kaffaa

Let's Implement Quran is an effort to follow the rule of science "If you can measure it, you can improve it", where we have collected all actionable verses, extracted orders from them and made them available to follow and track on your own pace.

# What was the way of companions?

They used to pick 10 aayaat from Quran, memorize them, understand what's expected from them in their lives, start implementing them in their lives and made sure they became their second nature before picking the next 10 aayaat.

# The best way of Implementing?

The way of companions is the best way of following any commandment of Allah, since the ayaat were revealed in front of their eyes and they implemented them under the supervision of our beloved and the greatest Prophet of all time Muhammad صلي الله عليه وسلم
